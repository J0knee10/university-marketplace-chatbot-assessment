# Prompt Analysis

When I designed `prompt.md`, my main goal was to make the chatbot feel both helpful and safe for students using the marketplace. I started by clearly defining its role: UniMarket Assistant is there to guide users through everyday actions like posting listings, searching for items, or contacting sellers. At the same time, it has to enforce university rules and watch out for risks like scams or prohibited items. That balance—being friendly and approachable while also protective—is reflected in the tone rules and the structured behaviors I included.

I also put a lot of thought into covering different situations students might run into. The conditional logic helps the chatbot respond differently depending on the problem: from guiding someone through posting a textbook, to warning them about policy violations, to escalating a threat or scam to a human moderator. I added technical support as well, since app crashes or upload issues are common and need to be routed correctly. To make sure responses are consistent and easy to review, I built in a JSON output schema that captures the intent, action, and escalation details.

Finally, I wanted the assistant to feel grounded in student life, not just like a generic marketplace bot. That’s why I added touches like referencing campus safety tips, student ID use, and events like dorm move-out sales. I also made sure the assistant doesn’t get stuck when a user asks something unclear—it can pause and ask clarifying questions before moving forward. Altogether, the design tries to strike a balance between being practical, safe, and tuned to the specific rhythms of university life.
